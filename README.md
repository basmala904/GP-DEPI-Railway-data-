## 🎯 Project Goal

To identify key factors causing journey delays in railway transportation and to explore how reducing delay time can:

- Increase ticket sales  
- Enhance customer satisfaction  
- Improve operational efficiency  
- Boost profitability through forecasting and simulation

---

## 🚀 Project Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Removed nulls, fixed inconsistent time formats  
   - Merged arrival times with date to build usable datetime columns

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Most delayed stations, times, and ticket types  
   - Calculated % of delayed vs on-time journeys  
   - Identified rush hours and top refund-request triggers

3. **KPI Definition**  
   - Average Delay Time  
   - Ticket Sales by Journey Date  
   - Delay to Refund Ratio  
   - % of delayed trips per week

4. **What-If Analysis** *(Tableau)*  
   > Simulated the impact of reducing delay by X%  
   > → Predicted boost in ticket sales and revenue

5. **Forecasting & Demand Prediction** *(Python)*  
   - Built ARIMA & Random Forest models  
   - Predicted daily ticket sales for the next month  
   - Helped in demand estimation & resource allocation

## 📊 Tableau Dashboards

We built Three dashboards tailored for different stakeholders:

- **Operations Dashboard**  
  Focuses on delay patterns, reasons, and station performance.

- **Executive Dashboard**  
  Highlights revenue impact, KPIs, and What-If simulations to support strategic decisions.

  **Customer Service Dashboard**  
  Visualizes refund requests, delay complaints, most affected routes, and overall passenger experience to help improve service quality.

## 📈 Ticket Demand Prediction (Next Month)

Using historical journey data, a Random Forest model was trained to forecast daily ride counts for the upcoming month.  
The company can now plan staff, trains, and ticket pricing **proactively**.

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, ARIMA, Random Forest  
- **SQL**: used to model tables & filter clean data  
- **Tableau**: dashboards, simulation, visuals  
- **Excel**: early preprocessing, time formatting

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

Our project proved that a **1% reduction in average delay** can increase ticket sales by an estimated **1.8–2.3%**, improving both revenue and satisfaction.  
Forecasting demand gave the company forward visibility to make smarter decisions.
